Single-Page CV

PROJECT 1.

This project is focused on creating a single-page HTML CV showcasing my career history.

The goal of this project is to learn how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. 

The focus would be laying out the following:
- education
- skills
- career history

in a clean, semantic manner. 
No styling will be addressed in this project.

This project is for https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
